order: 2
eyebrow: Protocol · Stellar
lede: LI.FI's routing was built for EVM chains. Bringing it to Stellar meant writing the Soroban contracts from scratch, matching the guarantees LI.FI gives users elsewhere, with a clean surface for its existing stack.

  title: Challenge
  body: 'LI.FI aggregates bridges and exchanges so users can move assets across chains in one transaction. Its stack was built for EVM chains, and Stellar is not one: contracts run on Soroban, in Rust, with Stellar''s own account, authorization and asset model. Bringing LI.FI to Stellar meant writing that layer natively, while keeping the guarantees LI.FI gives users everywhere else.'
- id: solution
  title: Solution
  body: |-
    LI.FI came to us directly, as a standard commercial engagement. We designed and built the entire smart-contract layer on Soroban, had it audited by Halborn, and delivered it into production.

    The contracts give LI.FI's existing stack a clean surface on Stellar, so a route on Stellar goes through the same interface as a route anywhere else.
- id: architecture
  title: Architecture highlights
  body: |-
    - Soroban contracts written for Stellar's authorization and asset model, not ported from EVM
    - Routes executed under the user's signed authorization or a token allowance
    - Tokens, native XLM included, addressed through their Stellar Asset Contracts
    - Third-party audit by Halborn before production
- id: outcome
  title: Outcome
  body: LI.FI is live on Stellar. According to LI.FI's documentation, users can swap on Stellar through Soroswap, bring USDC in from EVM chains through Circle's CCTP, bring XLM and USDC in through NEAR Intents, and send USDC out to ten EVM chains.
