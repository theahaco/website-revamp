  title: Challenge
  body: Tokenizing a regulated fund means the onchain representation has to mirror the legal structure exactly, support controlled transfers, and remain auditable for regulators, all while being efficient enough to run at scale.
- id: solution
  title: Solution
  body: |-
    We designed a compliance-aware token architecture that ties onchain units to the fund structure, supports transfer restrictions, and gives the administrator the controls they need without weakening the security model.

    The engagement runs as a fixed-scope, milestone-based integration: one scoping session with the manager's technical lead, an MOU with verifiable milestones, a first release on testnet with the operations team, then mainnet deployment, runbooks and handover at launch.
- id: architecture
  title: Architecture highlights
  body: |-
    - Fund units as a native Stellar asset with holder approval, freeze and clawback: tokens in circulation equal units on the register
    - One contract nets subscriptions against redemptions at the published NAV, so only the net goes to the depositary
    - NAV published onchain by the management company, which keeps the transfer-agent controls
    - Cash leg designed for a regulated euro stablecoin on the same ledger, with delivery versus payment in one step
- id: outcome
  title: Outcome
  body: Each milestone is validated as it is delivered. Launch is targeted for 2027, once the custody and depositary integrations are in place; subscriptions and redemptions will then run onchain under the manager's existing compliance controls. Settlement then happens in the same transaction as the order, not in days, and the manager, the depositary and the distributor share one register instead of reconciling three.
