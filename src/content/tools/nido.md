  body: |-
    A Nido wallet is a smart contract on Stellar, controlled by the passkeys on the user’s devices. There is no seed phrase to write down and no signing key on a server: setting one up takes a face or a fingerprint, in seconds.

    Every Nido mainnet wallet runs on a [Perch](/open-source/perch) account, so its rules are enforced onchain: spending caps, time-limited permissions for apps (session keys), and recovery by guardians, a zero-knowledge proof, or both. An app can ask for a session that spends up to a daily cap; the user approves once, and the account refuses anything beyond it.

    Nido moved from testnet to a curated mainnet release during Meridian 2026 in Lisbon. Its mainnet factory created 54 wallets in four days: 1 on October 26, 33 on October 27, 12 on October 28 and 8 on October 29.

    On testnet, Nido’s successive factories have created 705 wallets since June 1, 2026, our own testing included:

    | Month | Testnet wallets |

    | June 2026 | 248 |
    | July | 53 |
    | August | 39 |

- id: integrate
  title: Integrating it
  body: |-
    Integration takes a few lines. `@nidohq/stellar-wallets-kit-module` adds Nido to any Stellar Wallets Kit picker, and `@nidohq/passkey-sdk` covers custom flows; the repo ships an integration guide and an example dApp. The passkey SDK has 903 npm downloads since its June release, installs pulled in by the Wallets Kit module included (November 2, 2026).
- id: security
  title: Security and the open launch
  body: |-
    - Open source under Apache-2.0, with 364 commits to nidohq/nido (November 2, 2026).
    - 134 Rust tests (November 2, 2026), 91 of them with real passkey signatures and zero-knowledge proofs.
    - An audit preparation package in the repo: threat models (STRIDE included), security invariants, audit scope, runbooks and a mainnet readiness checklist. CoinFabrik Scout runs in CI.
    - Mainnet access stays curated until an external audit completes, and the open launch follows it.
