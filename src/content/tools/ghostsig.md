lede: 'GhostSig is a passkey web wallet for the XRP Ledger and Stellar. Its key is derived from the user’s passkey at each signature and never stored, and there is no backend. It is the default passkey module in the Stellar Wallets Kit and in XRPL Commons’ xrpl-connect. GhostSig is in beta, and the work continues.'

sections:
- id: what-it-does
  title: What it does
  body: |-
    GhostSig keeps no key. Each time the user signs, it derives the key from their passkey through the WebAuthn PRF extension, signs, and discards it. Nothing is written to storage, and there is no backend.

    - XRPL multi-purpose tokens and trust lines, and Stellar SEP-41 tokens
    - SLIP-39 split backups
    - A popup protocol any application can connect to, used by [Tansu](/open-source/tansu) and by Carbon Coin, our XRPL token demo
- id: where-it-ships
  title: Where it ships
  body: |-
    GhostSig is the default passkey module in the Stellar Wallets Kit, since v2.7.0, and in XRPL Commons’ xrpl-connect 1.0.0, so apps built on either kit can offer it without extra work. In xrpl-connect it is part of the main package and of its wallet picker; in the Stellar Wallets Kit it is one of the modules that follow SEP-43, Stellar’s wallet interface standard, exactly. One passkey wallet covers pilots on both networks.

    GhostSig is in beta: mainnet is enabled, it has not been audited yet, and the work continues. Pamphile Roy built it and maintains it, under the MIT license. Our other passkey wallet, [Nido](/open-source/nido), is a smart-account wallet for Stellar only, with its rules enforced onchain.
